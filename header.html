<h4> First Web Page With Bootstrap</h4>
<h1>Add the HTML5 doctype</h1> 

Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.<br>

Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:<br>
<h1> Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first</h1>

Bootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.<br>

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following meta tag inside the head element:<br>
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

<h1> Containers</h1>

Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.<br>

There are two container classes to choose from:<br>

1.The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container<br>
2.The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport<br>
